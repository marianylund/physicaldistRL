    "To explain it I came up with an important survival skill we all have today. The ability to go to Kiwi and back without meeting another person. Thus we are creating a survivor that can stand on one tile and see only one tile in front. Survivor can make 3 actions, look left, look right and move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a Q-table of possible states. It becomes a 5 x 5 x 3. First dimension for its standing state, 2nd for for s/he sees and 3 possible actions to take.\n",

    "### Q Table\n",
    "- Stand_states: null, someone, kiwi, house, border (5)\n",
    "- See_states: null, someone, kiwi, house, border (5)\n",
    "- Actions: left, right, forward (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards:\n",
    "- Taking 1 action: -1 (faster is better)\n",
    "- Standing on Kiwi: +50 if it is first time, then 0 (it is safe to look around whilst inside)\n",
    "- Standing with person: -10 (you might get infected)\n",
    "- Getting home: +30 or +200 if surviver has been to Kiwi, since that is the goal\n",
    "- Stand on border: -1000 (do not want it to get out of the radius)"
